# DDoSecrets News

## Context

DDoSecrets is a new transparency non-profit publishing hacks and leaks that serve the public's interest, which is at odds with corporate and state interests. 

## Problem

- Some social media sites have started blocking links to DDoSecrets.com. 

- DDoSecrets.com is built on MediaWiki, which has some limitations for how deeply it can be customized without beginning to maintain an entirely new skin.

## Solution

A new lightweight DDoSecrets mirror that enables a more flexible presentation of the critical content they host, removing any single points of failure, and increasing adoption by providing more user-friendly ways of consuming large amounts of information.
