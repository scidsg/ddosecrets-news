# DDoSecrets News

New prototype: https://scidsg.github.io/ddosecrets-news/

Primary org site: https://ddosecrets.com

## Context

DDoSecrets is a new transparency non-profit publishing hacks and leaks that serve the public's interest, which is at odds with corporate and state interests. 

## Problem

- Some social media sites have started blocking links to DDoSecrets.com. 

- DDoSecrets.com is built on MediaWiki, which has some limitations for how deeply it can be customized without beginning to maintain an entirely new skin.

## Solution

A new lightweight DDoSecrets mirror to keep their content more resilient to censorship, enables a more flexible presentation of the critical information they host, and increasing adoption by providing more user-friendly ways of consuming large amounts of information.
