# DDoSecrets News

## Problem

- DDoSecrets.com is a new and corageous group of individuals bringing transparency to those holding power and influence. As such, some sites have started to block links to their website. 

- DDoSecrets.com is built on MediaWiki, which has some limitations for how deeply it can be customized without beginning to maintain an entirely new skin.

## Solution

A new lightweight DDoSecrets mirror that enables a more flexible presentation of the critical content they host, removing any single points of failure, and increasing adoption by providing more user-friendly ways of consuming large amounts of information.
